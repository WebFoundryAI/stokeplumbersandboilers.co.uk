                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Stoke Plumbers and Boilers was founded in 2008 with a simple mission: to provide honest, reliable plumbing and heating services to the people of Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire. What began as a one-man operation has grown into a trusted local company with a team of skilled engineers, but we have never lost sight of the values that built our reputation.</p>
                <p>As a family-run business based in the heart of the Potteries, we understand our community. Many of our customers have been with us for years, trusting us with their plumbing and heating needs time and again. That trust is something we work hard to earn with every job we complete.</p>

                <h2>Our Team</h2>
                <p>Every member of our team is carefully selected for their skills, experience, and customer service attitude. All our gas engineers hold current Gas Safe registration and receive ongoing training to stay current with the latest technology and regulations. Our plumbers are time-served professionals with experience across all aspects of domestic plumbing.</p>
                <p>When an engineer arrives at your property, they carry identification and will explain clearly what work is needed and the associated costs before starting. We believe in transparency and treating customers' homes with respect.</p>

                <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quality workmanship</strong> - Every job completed to the highest standards</li>

                    <li><strong>Safety first</strong> - Full Gas Safe compliance on all gas work</li>
