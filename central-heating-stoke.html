                <h2>Comprehensive Central Heating Services</h2>
                <p>Stoke Plumbers and Boilers provides complete central heating services across Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire. From new boiler installations and full system upgrades to radiator additions and power flushing, our Gas Safe registered engineers deliver quality heating solutions tailored to your property and budget.</p>
                <p>Whether you are replacing an ageing system, extending heating to new rooms, or building from scratch, we provide expert advice and professional installation. Our heating surveys assess your requirements accurately, ensuring you get the right system for efficient, comfortable warmth.</p>

                <h2>New Boiler Installation</h2>
                <p>We supply and install boilers from leading manufacturers including Worcester Bosch, Vaillant, Baxi, Ideal, and Viessmann. As approved installers for several brands, we offer extended warranties of up to ten years on qualifying installations.</p>
                <p>Our boiler installation service includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Free home survey and quotation</li>
                    <li>Removal and disposal of old boiler</li>
                    <li>Full system flush to protect your new boiler</li>
                    <li>Installation of magnetic filter</li>
                    <li>Wireless thermostat upgrade options</li>
                    <li>Gas Safe certification and warranty registration</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Heating System Upgrades</h2>
                <p>Upgrading your heating system can significantly reduce energy bills and improve comfort. We offer various upgrade options:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>System conversion</strong> - Converting from conventional to combi or system boilers</li>
                    <li><strong>Controls upgrade</strong> - Smart thermostats and zoned heating</li>
                    <li><strong>Radiator upgrades</strong> - Larger or more efficient radiators</li>
                    <li><strong>Underfloor heating</strong> - New installations and repairs</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Power Flushing</h2>
                <p>Over time, central heating systems accumulate sludge, rust, and debris that reduce efficiency and cause breakdowns. Power flushing clears this contamination, restoring heat output and protecting your boiler. Signs you may need a power flush include cold spots on radiators, noisy boiler, slow heating, and frequent bleeding of radiators.</p>

                <h2>Radiator Services</h2>
                <p>We install, replace, and repair radiators throughout your home. Whether you need additional radiators for an extension, designer radiators for a renovation, or repairs to resolve leaks and cold spots, our engineers provide professional solutions.</p>
